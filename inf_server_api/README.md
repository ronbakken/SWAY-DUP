## Notes

As refresh tokens contain a cookie which is verified with 
a hashed value in the database, they cannot be regenerated by the server.
This allows us to trust refresh tokens, 
even if the private signing key were leaked.

Access tokens, however, can be generated at will by 
anyone who has access to the signing key.

For future purpose, it may be useful to have a separate 
signing key for the refresh tokens and access tokens,
with an expiration on the access signing keys.
